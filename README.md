About The Project:

There are many great automated mail git available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a mailboom so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:

#Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others.

#You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like sending a mail from device.


Of course, this will not serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this project!
